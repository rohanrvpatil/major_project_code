XAI - Reducing costs, finding optimal path between source &amp; destination

This paper solves the problem of finding a location to setup a factory/plant and using XAI to bring clarity in the functioning of machine learning models. The environment will be a grid with each cell having different characteristics. The goal would be to make sure political, economic, environmental, facility situation of the cell are ideal and it is at minimum distance from nearby coal mines. Finding an ideal location would ensure that costs are reduced and profits are earned from setting up the factory. Applying the concept of XAI will ensure that there is visibility in how the model is performing and the user experience is great.
